View the README.txt for general information about this module before installing.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

* The "curl" PHP library. Under Debian, apt-get install php5-curl.
  This library is necessary for when communicating credit card information
  with the payment gateway.

* The 'extensions' subdirectory must be writable by the web server (this is a civicrm requirement).

INSTALLATION:
------------

* Enable this module in Drupal, then enable the extention in CiviCRM.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > CiviMail > Message templates (/civicrm/admin/messageTemplates?reset=1),
  go to the "System messages" subtab. Edit the "Contributions - Receipt (on-line)" template
  and add the token "Desjardins CC receipt", i.e. {contribution.desjardins_receipt} in the 
  "credit card information" section of the template (both HTML and text formats).

* Override the templates/CRM/Contribute/Form/Contribution/ThankYou.tpl template and add
  the following: {$trxn_id|civicrmdesjardins_receipt} in order to show the credit card
  transaction receipt. (TODO: submit a patch to CiviCRM so that we can have this in core?)

  For example:

    <div class="crm-section no-label credit_card_details-section">
{*
      <div class="content">{$credit_card_type}</div>
      <div class="content">{$credit_card_number}</div>
      <div class="content">{ts}Expires{/ts}: {$credit_card_exp_date|truncate:7:''|crmDate}</div>
*}
      <div class="content">
        <pre>{$trxn_id|civicrmdesjardins_receipt}
      </div>
      {if $membership_amount and $is_separate_payment}
        <div class="content">
          <pre>{$membership_trx_id|civicrmdesjardins_receipt}
        </div>
     {/if}
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>

* In the receipt template, add a section with the "Terms and conditions", including
  your privacy policy, shipping fees (even if there are none) and refund policy.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > Configure > Domain information (civicrm/admin/domain?action=update&reset=1),
  make sure you have set correct values for the organisation name, e-mail and postal address.

* Create a custom field for contribution with a checkbox field "Terms and conditions" (ToS). 
  Include it in a footer profile for the contribution page, and make it mandatory. The help 
  text for the field should link (and open in a new window) to your site's terms and conditions
  (site privacy policy, terms of use, refund/cancellation policy, shipping policy).

  ToS must be visible on the contribution/event page, confirmation page and thank you page,
  as well as on the receipt. You may need to modify the message templates to integrate them.

* Either set your currency to "$ CAD" (but that is rather ugly), or add the following text
  at the end of the financial information of the Contribution/{Main,Confirm,ThankYou}.tpl:
  English: "All amounts are in canadian dollars ($ CAD)".
  French: "Tous les montants sont en dollars canadiens ($ CAD)".

* CRM-9491 : credit card information was not deleted from the session upon successful transaction.
  Re-apply the patch to ThankYou.php as described in the issue, until it is resolved.

Drupal variables:

* Set the civicrmdesjardins_tos_url and civicrmdesjardins_tos_text variables, with respectively
  the URL to your ToS and the description of your refund policy. This is not mandatory, but
  otherwise you will have to add it manually to your receipt footer.
  There is no UI for this yet, use drush vset.

* Desjardins requires that the name on the receipts be the formal organisation name (matching
  the name on their records). By default the domain name will be displayed (from the "domain
  information"). You can override it by setting the civicrmdesjardins_orgname Drupal variable.

* If you have a multi-lingual site, enable the 'variable' Drupal module, set the variables
  as multi-lingual (admin/config/regional/i18n/variable) then go to config > system > variables
  (admin/config/system/variable) to translate the variables.

During the validation process by Desjardins:

* Since the test environment of the payment gateway does not provide explicit numbers to
  trigger invalid transactions, you must disable the credit card number checks done by
  CiviCRM *only during the validation by Desjardins*.

  In Contribute/Form/Contribution/Main.php, function formRule(), comment out the following
  block of code:

/* 
    if ( CRM_Utils_Array::value( 'credit_card_number', $fields ) &&
         ! CRM_Utils_Rule::creditCardNumber( $fields['credit_card_number'], $fields['credit_card_type'] ) ) {
        $errors['credit_card_number'] = ts( 'Please enter a valid Credit Card Number' );
    }
*/

  Once the site has been validated, you can re-enable (uncomment) the code.


CAVEATS:
-------

* This module overrides your extension directory. (maybe we ought to find a better solution?)
